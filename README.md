# Flask Starter

This is a starter kit for Flask Apps. It's got a Flask instance running with Postgres. It also has a couple of starter routes. 

## Get Started

This repo is meant to be a starting point for larger projects, so to use it, download the code and set up a new repository.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed. From the project root, run `docker-compose up -d` to run in the foreground and `docker-compose up` to run in the background. This will boot up the Flask, Postgres, and volume containers. Your Flask instance should be running at localhost:2000.
